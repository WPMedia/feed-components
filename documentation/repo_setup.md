# Setup a new Outbound Feeds repo

This is a fusion themes based repository and is intended to be used as the starting point for using _Arc Outboundfeeds_. It doesn't matter if a client is currently using themes or not. This repo will be used to run Outbound feeds in its own dedicated environment.

## Setup

Pre-requisites:

- node / npm installed (node version > 10).
- docker

1. Create a template of this repo. Go to https://github.com/wapopartners/outboundfeeds-skeleton and click on the green "Use this template" button to create a new client repo. Name the new repo starting with the clients name like "ORG-outboundfeeds". Only include the prod branch. Once the new repo has been created, clone it to your local machine.

```
git clone git@github.com:wapopartners/ORG-outboundfeeds.git
```

2. Create a read-only personal access token in github

To be able to deploy outbound feeds you need to create a read-only token in [github](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token). This token needs to be added to your .npmrc file and will allow you to view and install outboundfeeds blocks. The .npmrc file must never be added to the repo and checked in. Please use the following format when setting up your .npmrc:

```
@wpmedia:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<your personal access token>
```

3. Install the packages

```
npm install
```

4. Create .env

   Copy env.example to .env and edit the file to replace the placeholders with your correct values.

   - `CONTENT_BASE` - Set your org in `https://api.${ORG}.arcpublishing.com` [ALC](https://redirector.arcpublishing.com/alc/arc-products/pagebuilder/fusion/documentation/recipes/defining-arc-content-source.md#configuring-content_base-and-arc_access_token-for-local-development)
   - `ARC_ACCESS_TOKEN` - your readonly developer token. [ALC](https://redirector.arcpublishing.com/alc/arc-products/developer/user-documentation/accessing-the-arc-api/?product=)
   - resizerKey - your orgs resizerKey. If you donâ€™t have it, please contact your Technical Delivery Manager (TDM)
   - `BLOCK_DIST_TAG` - To use production blocks, set this to 'stable', to use development blocks use 'beta'. Fusion defaults to stable if not set.

   The .env file is in .gitignore and should never be checked into github.

5. Update Mock websites

When running the editor locally the list of websites comes from a local file instead of your site service. To have your websites used, you must update the mock file `mocks/siteservice/api/v3/website` with your websites.

```
[
  {
    "_id": "website1",
    "display_name": "Website 1",
    "is_default_website": true
  },
  {
    "_id": "website2",
    "display_name": "Website 2",
    "is_default_website": false
  }
]
```

Run Fusion locally see [here](https://redirector.arcpublishing.com/alc/arc-products/pagebuilder/fusion/documentation/recipes/running-fusion-locally.md) for more details:

```
npx fusion start
```

Once fusion has finished starting you should be able to to get to the pagebuilder editor [pages](http://localhost/pagebuilder/pages) and [templates](http://localhost/pagebuilder/templates) to add and configure feeds locally.

Run tests with:

```
npm test
```

Run the linter with:

```
npm run lint
```

6. Once you are ready to deploy the bundle you will need to setup environment variables in the `environment/org-outboundfeeds.js` and or `environment/org-outboundfeeds-sandbox.js` files. Use the values from your local .env to set the `CONTENT_BASE` and `resizerKey`. Rename the files, replacing the clients org name with the `org` in the current names. Any values that should not be made public need to be [encrypted](https://redirector.arcpublishing.com/alc/arc-products/pagebuilder/fusion/documentation/recipes/using-environment-secrets.md).

Once you are ready to [deploy](https://staging.arcpublishing.com/alc/arc-products/pagebuilder/fusion/documentation/recipes/deploying-feature-pack.md) a bundle run the zip command.

```
npx fusion zip
```
