## Globals

- CONTENT_BASE

## Parameters

- dateField: ANS date field to use in range statement

- Include-Terms: If you donâ€™t want to use the default query you can enter a query here. It must be an array formatted like `[{"term":{"type": "story"}},{"range":{"last_updated_date:{"gte":"now-2d","lte":"now"}}}]`
- Exclude-Terms: If you need to exclude terms in your query (NOT) enter them here as an array formatted the same as the Include-Terms
- Feed-Size: Integer 1 to 100. Defaults to 100
- Feed-Offset: Integer. Defaults to 0
- Source-Exclude: ANS fields to exclude from the response. Defaults to `related_content`
- Sort: Comma separated list of fields to sort on. Defaults to `publish_date:desc`

- Include-Distributor-Category: distributor category, only the first populated distributor field will be used
- Exclude-Distributor-Category: distributor category, only the first populated distributor field will be used

### Usage

range is passed from dateField and dateRange.
latest:
{range: {gte: YYYY-MM-DD, lte: now}} YYYY-MM-DD is calculated from now - 1
YYYY-MM-DD:
{range: {gte: YYYY-MM-DD, lte: YYYY-MM-DD}}
